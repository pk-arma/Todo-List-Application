# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built using **ReactJS**. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and marking them as complete. It also provides a feature to remove all completed tasks, and it persists data in local storage so that tasks remain even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add new todo items**: Users can add a new task by entering a title and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark items as complete/incomplete**: Users can toggle the completion status of a task by checking/unchecking the checkbox next to the todo item.
- **Edit todo titles**: Users can double-click on a todo item to edit its title. Once edited, pressing "Enter" or clicking outside will save the changes.
- **Clear completed tasks**: A button is provided to remove all completed tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: The todo list is stored in the browser's local storage so that it remains intact even if the page is refreshed.
